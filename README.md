# npp
simple model of nuclear power plant(NPP) in combination with some reinforcement learning

# Disclaimer
This model was mainly created to get me started with reinforcement learning and improve my python coding.
Furthermore, I'm neither a nuclear physicist nor do I work with nuclear reactors in any way. \n
To create this model, I taught myself the basics of how NPPs work, but still I am no expert. \n

This is severely simplified and does not capture all things to consider when operating a NPP. \n
However, it should still be able to capture the essence of how a NPP operates.

Please don't use this to operate your NPP ;)
